    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>Windsor is a city in southwestern Ontario, Canada, on the south bank of the Detroit River directly across from
        Detroit, Michigan, United States. The city's population was 229,660 at the 2021 census, making it the third-most
        populated city in Southwestern Ontario, after London and Kitchener. The Detroit–Windsor urban area is North
        America's most populous trans-border conurbation, and the Ambassador Bridge border crossing is the busiest
        commercial crossing on the Canada–United States border.</p>

    <h2>Climate</h2>
    <p>Located in the far south of Ontario, close to the American city of Detroit, Windsor enjoys the warmest climate of
        any of Ontario’s cities.
        Windsor has a semi-continental climate, with a warm, humid summer and a cold winter.
        Windsor’s climate is modified by its location on the shores of the Great Lakes. The water in the lakes ensures
        Windsor is warmer in winter and cooler in summer than it would otherwise be. The lakes are also the source of
        Windsor’s summer humidity, which many people find uncomfortable.</p>

    <h2>Location</h2>
    <p>Geographically located within but administratively independent of Essex County, it is the southernmost city in Canada and marks the southwestern end of the Quebec City–Windsor Corridor.</p>


    <h2>Other Information</h2>
    <p>Windsor is a major contributor to Canada's automotive industry and is culturally diverse. Known as the "Automotive Capital of Canada", Windsor's industrial and manufacturing heritage is responsible for how the city has developed through the years.</p>
